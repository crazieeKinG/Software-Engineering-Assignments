###### You are to write a program that reads in lines of input using scanf or cin, and file redirection, process the data, and then out the results using printf or cout. This means you can use C, C++, Java, Php, Python  or any other style I/O as is your personal preference.

1. Each line of the data file begins with an 'e', 'c', or 't'.
2. Lines beginning with 'e' will have an integer employee ID and an employee name.
3. Lines beginning with 'c' will have an integer customer ID, customer name, and a floating point account balance.
4. Lines beginning with a 't' will have a customer ID, employee ID, a 'w' or 'd' representing withdrawal or deposit,and a floating point transaction amount.
5. Lines beginning with an 'e' and 'c' may be intermingled, but all 'e' and 'c' lines will come before lines beginning
with 't'.
6. There will be at most 50 employees and 50 customers, and an unknown number of transactions. Names will be at
most 15 characters long.

An example data file is shown below:
Copy these lines and save it as data.txt and your program should use that file.

Your program should read in the employee and customer information and update the customer account balance depending
on the transaction. For example, t 1 8 w 4924.86 means to update the balance for customer 1 by withdrawing
4924.86 from Devon's account balance of 56442.27875. For each transaction, output customer name, the employee
name, a plus sign for deposit or a minus sign for withdrawal, the transaction amount, and the new balance after the
transaction with two decimal places (truncate values; do not worry about rounding). For example, the output for the
example transaction above would appear as (include the line of digits):

```
123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
        Devon Kourtney -$4924.86 $ 51517.42
```

For the above the data file, your output would be:

```

You should create data structures to hold the data for each employee and for the customers,
including their current balance. Then create arrays of these structures. You will need
counters to keep track of the next available space in each array, as well as to use for
loop control when searching for information. The arrays may be fixed size base on the
limits provided above. When you receive a 't" command you can get the employee name
and customer name and balance from the arrays. Be sure to update the customer balance
to complete the transaction processing. You will output the information as described above.

When you have completed and tested your program on the your system, submit upload it to the assignment as lab_2_your_name_roll_number. Be sure to include all the files needed to compile, link and run your program
if you created more than a single program file.
